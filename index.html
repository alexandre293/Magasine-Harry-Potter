                    Rumors persist about the recent unrest at the Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was seen again. “Don’t ask about anything, we’re forbidden to talk about it,” said a very agitated Memory Eraser, who wished to remain anonymous, at the exit from the Ministry last night. However, senior Ministry sources confirm that the legendary Hall of Prophecies is at the center of the unrest. Although Ministry officials still refuse to even confirm that such a place exists, a significant part of the wizarding community is convinced that the Death Eaters, currently serving time in Azkaban for trespassing and attempted robbery, wanted to steal a certain prophecy. No one knows what the prophecy is, but many believe it concerns Harry Potter, the only person we know to have survived the Killing Curse and who we know was present at the Ministry the night of the riot. Some even call Potter "The Chosen One", believing that, according to prophecy, he alone is capable of ridding us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Where the prophecy is now, if it actually exists, is unknown.
